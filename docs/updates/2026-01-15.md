# Update Log - 2026-01-15

This is a detailed record of work done to get the multi-tool ready for Cloudflare Pages and to stabilize the UI layout. It also captures key decisions and current open items.

## Build and Deploy Readiness

- Cloudflare Pages build path confirmed: `npm run build`, output `dist`, root `/`.
- Local build verified with `tsc && vite build`.
- React 19 peer conflicts resolved earlier via lockfile updates (now building cleanly).
- In-repo dependencies (`shared/` and `errl-design-system/`) wired via Vite/TS config so Cloudflare builds without external paths.

## Runtime Stability

- React error #185 and "maximum update depth" traced to unstable Zustand selectors.
- Scene editors updated to use stable selectors per field (removes object selector loops).

## Layout and UI Changes

- Layout presets: split (50/50), canvas-dominant (75/25), canvas-only, editor-only, and editor-drawer.
- Drawer layouts now open by default and include visible handle bars.
- Right inspector becomes an overlay panel with a collapsed sliver handle.
- Asset shelf is now a bottom drawer with a handle and height-based collapse (header stays visible).
- Stage canvas auto-fits as a square and stretches to full height in split layouts.
- Left toolbar padding tightened to reduce unused space.

## Asset Shelf UX

- Asset shelf is tabbed (Assets, Components, Prefabs, Actions).
- Content is horizontal scroll only to stay within the shelf height; no vertical scroll required.
- Compact search bar in the shelf header to preserve space.

## Top Bar and Project Naming

- App branding updated to "Errl Multi-Tool Design Suite".
- Sample project name updated from "Ghost Forest Prototype".
- Health badge and theme controls removed from the top bar (were not functional).

## Documentation Updates

- Consolidated README and docs into a concise, public-friendly set.
- Deployment instructions confirmed for Cloudflare Pages (design.errl.wtf).
- AI features documented as optional with API-key gating.

## Open Items

- Theme switching/light-dark support needs a functional pass (currently removed from top bar).
- Confirm which top-bar controls should remain after final UX review.
- Verify layout behavior on more screen sizes (desktop + mobile).
