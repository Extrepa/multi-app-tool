To give **Cursor** the specific logic it needs for the "Vibe Check" and the "FX Lab," we need a dedicated file for the behavior engine. This ensures the AI doesn't just build a static UI, but understands how to apply "vibrancy" and "motion" to your SVGs.

Here are the next two Markdown files to complete your set.

## File 4: FX_LAB_VIBE_LOGIC.md

```markdown
# FX Lab & Vibe Check Logic Specification

## Objective
The FX Lab takes a static SVG/PNG "Prop" and applies non-destructive visual effects and behavioral logic to turn it into a "Component."

## Vibe Parameters (The "Vibe Check")
Every component should support a standard set of "Vibe" properties:
1. **Pulse:** Scaling the asset up and down (Speed, Intensity).
2. **Glow:** CSS filters or SVG filters for neon/bloom effects (Radius, Color, Flicker).
3. **Float:** Sinusoidal movement on the Y-axis (Amplitude, Frequency).
4. **Shake:** Random jitter for "unstable" or "energy" objects.
5. **Rotation:** Constant spin or "pendulum" swing.

## Scripting / Logic Bridge
- **Trigger System:** Components should have basic triggers (OnHover, OnClick, OnLoad).
- **State Changes:** Toggle between "Vibe A" and "Vibe B" (e.g., a button that glows brighter when hovered).

## Implementation for Cursor
- Use CSS Keyframes or a library like `Framer Motion` or `GSAP` to handle these vibes.
- Ensure the "Scene Maker" can toggle these animations on/off globally to save performance during layout.

## File 5: EXPORT_PIPELINE_FLASH.md

```markdown
# Export Pipeline & Platform Integration

## Output Formats
1. **The Flash Bundle:** - Convert the JSON Scene Graph into a format compatible with the target Flash engine (e.g., OpenFL or Haxe).
   - Bundle all SVGs into a single asset manifest.
2. **Component Module:** - Export a standalone React/JS component with the SVG embedded and FX logic as props.
3. **Static Export:** - High-res PNG/SVG capture of the entire Scene.

## Asset Optimization
- **Path Simplification:** Clean up redundant SVG nodes during export.
- **Atlas Generation:** Combine PNG props into a sprite sheet for game engine efficiency.

## Cursor Instructions
- Build an "Export Modal" that allows the user to select the target platform.
- Write a "Sanitizer" function that ensures IDs in the JSON don't conflict when multiple components are exported together.

```

## How to Organize the Workspace

When you feed these to Cursor, suggest this folder structure to help the AI maintain the separation of concerns:

```text
/src
  /components
    /Editors
      SVGEditor.tsx        <-- The "Focus" Window
      SceneCanvas.tsx      <-- The "Stage" Window
    /Library
      AssetShelf.tsx       <-- The Bottom Tray
    /Inspector
      ContextualPanel.tsx  <-- Sidebar for SVG/FX/Scene
  /state
    useStore.ts            <-- Zustand/Redux using ARCH_DATA_SCHEMA
  /engine
    vibeLogic.ts           <-- Logic from FX_LAB_VIBE_LOGIC

```

### Final Step for your Cursor Prompt:

Once you have these files in your project, use this prompt to start the coding process:

> *"@PRD_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md @ARCH_DATA_SCHEMA.md @UI_LAYOUT_SPEC.md @FX_LAB_VIBE_LOGIC.md @EXPORT_PIPELINE_FLASH.md Start by initializing the project structure. Create the global state store first based on the JSON schema, then build the Dual-Viewport layout with a Focus Window on the left and a Stage Canvas on the right. Ensure clicking a Prop in the Stage loads it into the Focus Window."*

**Would you like me to draft a sample `vibeLogic.ts` file so Cursor knows exactly how to code the pulse and glow animations?**
