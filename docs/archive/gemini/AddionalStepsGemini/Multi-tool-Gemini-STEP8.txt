We are now advancing to **Step #116: Implement the "Shake" Oscillator**. This completes the core movement suite in the **Lab**, providing the necessary logic for randomized impact and high-frequency vibrations.

### 1. The "Shake" Logic (Randomized Displacement)

Unlike the smooth harmonic curves of **Pulse** or **Float**, the **Shake** oscillator introduces controlled chaos into the coordinate system. It uses a pseudo-random seed to generate high-frequency displacement, perfect for "Damage" effects or environmental rumble.

* **Logic**: On every tick of the **Global  Ticker**, the object's  and  coordinates are offset by a value within a specified amplitude range.
* **Intensity Control**: The "Intensity" slider in the **Surgical Inspector** scales the maximum possible displacement, allowing for everything from a subtle nervous twitch to a violent screen-shaking impact.

### 2. Implementation: The Shake Function (`src/utils/vibeLibrary.ts`)

The Shake function is added to the **Vibe Engine** to handle non-sinusoidal motion.

```typescript
// Resource: Shake Logic Extension
export const ShakeOscillator = (amp: number) => {
  // Returns a random offset between -amp and +amp
  const offsetX = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2 * amp;
  const offsetY = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2 * amp;
  
  return { x: offsetX, y: offsetY };
};

```

### 3. Integrated Vibe Stacking

With all four core vibes (**Pulse, Float, Breathe, Shake**) active, the engine now supports **Vibe Stacking**. You can apply a slow **Float** to simulate weightlessness while adding a high-frequency **Pulse** to simulate a glowing "Neon" heart—all calculated in real-time within the **Studio Store**.

### 4. Verification & Progress Track

With the "Shake" oscillator complete, you have finished the core "Vibe" movement suite.

| Build Step | Technical Milestone | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **#116** | Shake Oscillator (Randomized impact motion) implemented. | **DONE** |
| **#117** | Speed (Frequency) controls finalized in Inspector. | **ACTIVE** |
| **#118** | Intensity (Amplitude) controls finalized in Inspector. | **ACTIVE** |

**Would you like to proceed to Step #117 to finalize the "Speed" and "Intensity" UI controls in the Surgical Inspector, ensuring they map perfectly to your math oscillators?**
