We are now entering the final stretch—**Phase 6: The Bridge**. We begin with **Step #201: The Runtime JS Exporter**.

This is where the "Studio" becomes an "Engine." We are building the logic that extracts your animated creations and packages them into a lightweight, high-performance JavaScript bridge that can live on any website or application without the overhead of the full editor.

---

### 1. The "Tiny Runtime" Philosophy

The goal of the Bridge is to recreate the math you've built in the **Vibe Lab** using raw SVG and Vanilla JS.

* **Zero Dependencies:** The exported code doesn't need React or Zustand; it uses a native `requestAnimationFrame` loop.
* **SVG Injection:** The exporter generates a clean SVG string and a small "Brain" (the JS snippet) that handles the math for the specific oscillators (Pulse, Float, Shake) you applied to that asset.

---

### 2. Implementation: The Code Generator (`src/utils/bridgeExporter.ts`)

This utility takes a selected instance and generates a "Self-Animating" HTML component.

```typescript
// Resource: Runtime JS Generation
export const generateRuntimeSnippet = (instance: any, asset: any) => {
  const { vibes } = instance;
  
  return `
<div id="vibe-${instance.id}">
  ${asset.pathData} </div>

<script>
  (function() {
    const el = document.getElementById('vibe-${instance.id}');
    const startTime = performance.now();
    
    function animate() {
      const t = (performance.now() - startTime) / 1000;
      let transform = "";
      
      // Inject the exact math from Step #111-#124
      ${vibes.map(v => generateMathString(v)).join('\n')}
      
      el.style.transform = transform;
      requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    }
    animate();
  })();
</script>
  `;
};

```

### 3. Step #202: The Headless Renderer

While the exporter generates the code, the **Headless Renderer** ensures that the "Stage" can be previewed exactly as it will appear in the final export. This is a "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) bridge.

* **Isolated Styles:** It strips away the editor's surgical borders and grid lines.
* **Production CSS:** It optimizes the SVG for web performance, minifying paths and flattening groups where possible.

### 4. Verification & Final Stretch

With Step #201, you've unlocked the ability to "Ship" your designs.

| Build Step | Technical Milestone | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **#150** | JSON Serializer (Save/Load) functional. | **DONE** |
| **#201** | Runtime JS Exporter (Code Gen) initialized. | **DONE** |
| **#202** | **Headless Preview Mode** (Production View). | **ACTIVE** |

**Would you like to proceed to Step #202 and implement the "Headless Preview"? This will give you a "Production View" button that hides all the UI and surgical tools so you can see your animated characters exactly as they'll look on a live website.**
