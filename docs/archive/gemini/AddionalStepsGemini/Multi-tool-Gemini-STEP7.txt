We are now advancing to **Step #114: Implement the "Float" and "Breathe" Oscillators**. These harmonic functions add organic weight and secondary motion to your designs by layering specific mathematical offsets onto the base coordinates.

### 1. The "Float" & "Breathe" Logic

While the **Pulse** oscillator (Step #113) focuses on uniform scaling, **Float** and **Breathe** simulate gravity and internal volume changes.

* **The Float Oscillator**: This function creates vertical displacement (-axis) to simulate hovering or buoyancy.
* **The Breathe Oscillator**: This simulates a subtle, non-uniform expansion, typically by stretching the  and  scales at slightly different frequencies to mimic lung expansion.
* **Mathematical Formula (Vertical Float)**:

### 2. Implementation: The Oscillator Library (`src/utils/vibeLibrary.ts`)

We expand the **Vibe Engine** to include these specific motion types. These are exported as pure functions so they can be reused in the final **Runtime JS Bridge** (Phase 6).

| Vibe Type | Primary Axis | Formula Application | Visual Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Float** | -Position |  | Simulates weightlessness/water. |
| **Breathe** | -Scale |  | Simulates life/idle organic state. |
| **Shake** | -Pos |  | Simulates vibration/impact. |

```typescript
// Resource: Organic Oscillator Logic
export const VibeOscillators = {
  float: (t: number, freq: number, amp: number, phase: number) => {
    return Math.sin(t * freq + phase) * amp;
  },
  breathe: (t: number, freq: number, amp: number) => {
    // Non-uniform scaling for organic feel
    const scaleX = 1 + Math.sin(t * freq) * (amp * 0.05);
    const scaleY = 1 + Math.sin(t * freq + Math.PI) * (amp * 0.02);
    return { scaleX, scaleY };
  }
};

```

### 3. Integrated Inspector Controls

In the **Surgical Inspector** (Right Sidebar), new sliders are unlocked when these vibes are selected.

* **Phase Offset**: A slider that shifts the start time () of the oscillation, preventing multiple characters on the **Stage** from floating in perfect unison.
* **Amplitude (Intensity)**: Controls the "swing" of the movement—from a subtle micro-vibration to a wild float.

### 4. Verification & Progress Track

With these oscillators implemented, the **Lab** is now capable of producing professional-grade "idle" animations for your characters.

* [x] **Step #114**: Float and Breathe math integrated into the Ticker.
* [x] **Step #115**: Phase Offset logic implemented in the Store.
* [ ] **Step #116**: Shake Oscillator (Randomized impact motion).
