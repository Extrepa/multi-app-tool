We are now advancing to **Step #121: Initialize the Vibe Preset Library**. This module provides a set of pre-configured mathematical templates, allowing you to apply professional motion "personalities" to your characters and props with a single click.

### 1. The Preset Architecture

A "Vibe Preset" is a collection of specific oscillator settings (Frequency, Amplitude, and Phase) that have been fine-tuned to evoke a particular emotion or physical state. By storing these in a library, you ensure consistency across different scenes and instances.

| Preset Name | Target Emotion | Primary Oscillator | Math Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Neon Breathe** | Atmospheric / Ethereal | Pulse + Opacity | Slow frequency (), High amplitude. |
| **Ghost Drift** | Spooky / Weightless | Float (-axis) | Very slow frequency (), Random phase. |
| **Heartbeat** | Vital / Intense | Pulse () | High frequency (), Sudden amplitude spikes. |
| **Jitter** | Nervous / High-energy | Shake () | Max frequency (), Low amplitude. |

### 2. Implementation: The Preset Store (`src/data/vibePresets.ts`)

This static library acts as the "DNA" for the **Vibe Lab**, providing the data injected into the `updateVibe` action in the **Studio Store**.

```typescript
// Resource: Vibe Preset Definitions
export const VibePresets = {
  NEON_BREATHE: {
    frequency: 0.5,
    intensity: 0.8,
    offset: 0,
    type: 'PULSE'
  },
  GHOST_DRIFT: {
    frequency: 0.2,
    intensity: 0.4,
    offset: Math.random() * 360,
    type: 'FLOAT'
  }
};

```

### 3. Integrated Preset UI

The **Surgical Inspector** (Right Sidebar) now features a "Quick Presets" dropdown.

* **One-Click Application**: Selecting a preset instantly updates the **Zustand Store**, which in turn updates the **Global Ticker** and the SVG on the **Stage**.
* **Template Forking**: Users can apply a preset as a starting point and then use the **Speed** and **Intensity** sliders (Step #117) to customize the movement further.

### 4. Verification & Progress Track

With the Preset Library initialized, you have moved from raw math to artistic expression.

| Build Step | Technical Milestone | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **#121** | Vibe Preset Library (Neon, Ghost, Heartbeat) initialized. | **DONE** |
| **#122** | Multi-Vibe stacking logic implemented. | **ACTIVE** |
| **#123** | Color-cycle vibes (SVG Stroke/Fill oscillators) initialized. | **ACTIVE** |

**Would you like to proceed to Step #122 to implement "Multi-Vibe Stacking," allowing you to layer a "Heartbeat" pulse on top of a "Ghost Drift" float for complex, lifelike motion?**
