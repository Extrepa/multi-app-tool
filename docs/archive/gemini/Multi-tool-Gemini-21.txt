To move this into a functional build phase, we need to finalize the **Pro Hotkey Map** and the **Logic-to-Visual Interface**. This ensures that the user can navigate the four-app ecosystem without ever touching a menu.

Here is the "Muscle Memory" blueprint and the final organizational layout for the **Inspector Section**.

---

## 1. The Pro Hotkey Map (Muscle Memory)

Cursor needs these defined to build a truly professional "Flow State" experience.

| Key | Tool / Mode | Context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **V** | **Select Tool** | Global: Move, scale, and rotate objects on the Stage. |
| **A** | **Node Editor** | Forge: Direct manipulation of SVG anchor points. |
| **P** | **Pen Tool** | Forge: Create new Bezier paths and custom pins. |
| **S** | **Shape Tool** | Forge: Drop standard primitives (hold Shift for 1:1 ratio). |
| **F** | **Fit to View** | Global: Centers the selected object in the active workspace. |
| **G** | **Group** | Stage: Combine multiple props into a single "Scene Component." |
| **1 / 2 / 3** | **Mode Swap** | Global: 1: Forge (Draw), 2: Lab (Anim), 3: Stage (Layout). |
| **Space (Hold)** | **Pan Canvas** | Global: Drag to move around the infinite workspace. |

## 2. The Inspector: Deep Dive into "Sectional Control"

The right-hand panel is the heart of the "Multi-App" integration. It must be strictly partitioned so every setting has a permanent home.

### A. The Transform Section (Universal)

Every object, whether a raw SVG or a complex Scene Component, has these:

* **Coordinates:**  (Z-index layering).
* **Dimensions:**  (with aspect ratio lock).
* **Rotation:**  to  dial.

### B. The Stylist Section (SVG Creator/Editor)

Appears when a vector path is active:

* **Fill:** Solid, Linear Gradient, Radial Gradient, or Image Pattern.
* **Border (Stroke):** * *Width:* Thickness in pixels.
* *Join:* Miter, Round, or Bevel.
* *Type:* Solid, Dashed, or Dotted (with custom gap spacing).



### C. The Vibe Section (FX Lab)

This is where the "Behavior" is controlled:

* **Preset Library:** "Ghostly," "Neon Pulse," "Mechanical Jitter."
* **Parameters:** Speed, Amplitude (intensity), and Offset (timing).
* **Signal Mapping:** A toggle to link the effect to a "Game Signal" (e.g., when player health is low, the pulse turns red).

## 3. UI Separation & Visual Hierarchy

To prevent the "4-in-1" interface from feeling cluttered, we use **Strict Border Management**.

* **The 1px Rule:** Every panel (Toolbar, Layer Tree, Inspector) is separated by a 1px solid border (`#333333`).
* **Active Workspace Glow:** * When you are in **Forge Mode**, the "Focus Window" border turns **Emerald**.
* When you are in **Stage Mode**, the "Scene Canvas" border turns **Electric Purple**.
* This tells the user exactly where their hotkeys (like  or ) will be applied.

## 4. The Final Project Manifest (The "JSON" Export)

When the user hits "Save" or "Export," the system generates a single file that contains everything. Here is how that data is structured:

```json
{
  "project_id": "neon_forest_01",
  "meta": { "resolution": "1920x1080", "fps": 60 },
  "library": {
    "assets": [ 
      { "id": "pin_tree", "data": "M10 80 L50 10 L90 80 Z", "fill": "#2D5A27" } 
    ],
    "components": [
      { "id": "comp_pulsing_tree", "ref": "pin_tree", "vibe": { "type": "pulse", "speed": 1.2 } }
    ]
  },
  "scene": [
    { "ref": "comp_pulsing_tree", "pos": [500, 300], "scale": 1.5 }
  ]
}

```

### Ready for the First Build?

You have the 38-file architecture, the UI Mockups, the JSON schema, and the Pro Hotkey map. You are ready to open Cursor and begin.
