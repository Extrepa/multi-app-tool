To turn your four distinct tools into a professional-grade "Studio Ecosystem," the interface must be divided into rigid, functional zones. This ensures that every mouse click and every tool has a predictable location and a specific purpose within your creation-to-animation pipeline.

The layout is structured around a **Master Design Shell**, divided into five key sections.

---

### 1. The Global Toolbar (The "Brain")

**Location:** Fixed at the very top of the screen.

**Purpose:** High-level project management and global settings.

* **Mode Switcher:** Icons to toggle between **Forge** (SVG Creation), **Stage** (Scene Layout), **Lab** (Animation), and **Pin** (Final Polish).
* **Project Meta:** Project name, "Auto-save" status, and the **Master Export** button.
* **Universal Settings:** Global snap-to-grid toggles, canvas zoom level, and dark/light mode.

### 2. The Tool Dock (The "Forge")

**Location:** Narrow vertical strip on the far left.

**Purpose:** Every capability of a common vector editor, logically grouped.

* **Creation Group:** * **Pen Tool ():** For Bezier curves and custom node placement.
* **Shape Tool ():** Standard vectors (Rect, Circle, Star, Polygon).
* **Text Tool ():** Vectorized typography.


* **Modification Group:** * **Node Tool ():** Specifically for editing individual anchor points on an SVG path.
* **Bucket Fill ():** For applying gradients and solid fills.
* **Stroke Stylist:** Controls for border width, dash arrays, and corner miter/roundness.



### 3. The Hierarchy & Layer Tree (The "Structure")

**Location:** Nested on the inner-left, next to the Tool Dock.

**Purpose:** Clear vertical organization of every asset.

* **Groups & Folders:** Icons to collapse/expand nested components.
* **Visibility & Lock:** Eye icons to hide elements and padlocks to prevent accidental edits.
* **Type Indicators:** Visual cues that distinguish a raw **SVG Path** from a **Vibe-Checked Component**.

### 4. The Workspace Viewport (The "Stage")

**Location:** The expansive central area.

**Purpose:** Direct interaction with your assets.

* **Clear Borders:** The workspace is separated from toolbars by a high-contrast 1px border.
* **Dual-Canvas Logic:**
* In **Forge Mode**, this shows a single asset at 400% zoom with a visible node grid.
* In **Stage Mode**, it shows the full scene boundary with "Director's" guides (safe areas, rule of thirds).



### 5. The Inspector & FX Lab (The "Control")

**Location:** Broad panel on the far right.

**Purpose:** Contextual controls that change based on what you select.

* **Section A: Basic Properties:** X/Y coordinates, Width/Height, Rotation, and Opacity.
* **Section B: The Border & Fill Lab:** * Color pickers with HEX, RGB, and HSL support.
* Border (Stroke) style controls.


* **Section C: The Vibe Check (Animation):**
* A mini-timeline for keyframing.
* Preset dropdowns for "Pulse," "Float," or "Shake" (Vibes).
* Logic triggers: "On Click," "On Hover," or "Looping."

### The Functional Workflow Summary

| Section | Action | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tool Dock** | Select Pen Tool | Ready to draw raw vector paths. |
| **Hierarchy** | Move Layer Up | Changes Z-index, bringing prop to the front. |
| **Workspace** | Drag Object | Updates X/Y coordinates in the Inspector. |
| **FX Lab** | Set "Pulse" | Applies real-time CSS/JSON animation to the asset. |
| **Global Bar** | Hit "Export" | Bundles everything into a production-ready file. |

**Would you like me to refine the "FX Lab" controls specifically for your Flash/Game engine exports, or shall we focus on the "Pen Tool" node-editing logic next?**
