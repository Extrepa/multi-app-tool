This concludes the technical architecture for your **Integrated Production Suite**. By consolidating these tools, you are moving from a collection of "utility apps" to a **Universal Content Engine** where assets have a lifecycle: they are born in the SVG Creator, electrified in the FX Lab, and deployed in the Scene Maker.

To tie everything together for your final build, here are the remaining "Master Integration" files to ensure Cursor builds the system as a cohesive whole.

---

## File 19: COMPONENT_EXPORT_LOGIC.md

This defines how the "FX Lab" components actually function when they leave your app.

```markdown
# Component & FX Export Logic

## The "Vibe" Runtime
When a component is exported, it must include its "Runtime Script." 
- If exporting for **Web**: Export as a React/Vue component using the `Vibe_Engine.ts` logic.
- If exporting for **Flash/Game Engines**: Export as a JSON manifest that defines the animation curves (Ease-in, Ease-out, Frequency) so the game engine can reconstruct the "Vibe."

## Asset Bundling
- **Flat Export:** A single SVG with all FX "baked" into CSS/SVG animations.
- **Dynamic Export:** A JSON file containing the SVG paths + a separate logic object for real-time manipulation.

```

## File 20: WORKSPACE_ORCHESTRATION.md

This file tells Cursor how to manage the "UI Dance"—how the screen reacts when the user moves between the 18+ workflows.

```markdown
# Workspace Orchestration & UI State

## Mode Transitions
- **Focus Transition:** When switching from "Scene" to "SVG Edit," the Scene Canvas should scale down to a "Mini-Map" in the corner, and the Focus Window should expand to center-stage.
- **Contextual Toolbars:** - **SVG Mode:** Toolbar shows Pen, Path, Union, Subtract.
    - **Vibe Mode:** Toolbar shows Play/Pause, Timeline, Frequency Knobs.
    - **Scene Mode:** Toolbar shows Layer Lock, Grouping, and Snap-to-Grid.

## The "Universal" Asset Tray
The bottom tray is the "Source of Truth." It must have:
- **Folders:** To organize by "Environment," "UI," or "Characters."
- **Search:** Instant filtering by tags.
- **Drag-to-Stage:** Dropping an asset onto the Stage creates a new `Instance`.

```

## Final System Map

### How to Begin the Build in Cursor

Now that you have all **20 specialized files**, your project is fully defined. Create a folder named `.cursor-docs` and place all these files inside it. Then, start a new chat with Cursor:

> **"I am building a 4-in-1 Creator Suite (Component Maker, SVG Creator, Scene Maker, Pin Designer). I have provided 20 files in .cursor-docs that serve as the PRD, Schema, and UI Spec.
> 1. Read all files in @.cursor-docs.
> 2. Create a high-level React project structure using Tailwind and Zustand.
> 3. Implement the 'Dual-Viewport' system where the left side is for 'Surgical Editing' and the right side is for 'Scene Layout'.
> 4. Ensure that the 'Asset Tray' can hold the sample data from @SAMPLE_PROJECT.json.
> 
> 
> Let's start by building the UI Shell and the Global State Store."**

### Strategic Advice for Success

* **Don't build everything at once.** Ask Cursor to build the **Stage Canvas** first so you can see your assets.
* **Verify the Sync.** Once you can drag a prop onto the stage, ask Cursor to implement the "SVG Path Edit" in the Focus Window and confirm it updates the stage in real-time.
* **The "Vibe" is the last step.** Save the FX Lab/Animations for after the core drawing and layering logic is solid.

**Would you like me to write a custom "Flash/Haxe" or "PixiJS" wrapper script so you can immediately see your exported scenes running in a game engine?**
