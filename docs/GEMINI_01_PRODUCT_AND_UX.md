# Gemini Summary 01 - Product and UX

## Purpose
Create a unified studio that moves users from asset creation to animation to scene layout, without context switching.

## Core Pipeline
- Forge: draw and edit SVG/PNG assets.
- Lab: apply Vibe effects and behavior.
- Stage: compose scenes with reusable instances.
- Export: ship to web or game runtimes.

## Product Pillars
- Pin Designer (precision vector tools).
- FX Lab (real-time vibe effects).
- Component Maker (logic-ready assets).
- Scene Maker (layered composition).

## Workspace Zones
- Global toolbar: mode switcher, project meta, export, global toggles.
- Tool dock (left outer): creation and editing tools.
- Layer tree (left inner): hierarchy and organization.
- Workspace (center): Forge or Stage viewport.
- Inspector (right): contextual controls.
- Asset tray (bottom): library thumbnails and drag to Stage.

## Mode Behavior
- Forge mode: single-asset focus with zoomed editing.
- Stage mode: full scene composition with layout guides.
- Lab mode: effect tuning and live preview controls.
- Mode switching does not reset canvas state.

## UI Rules
- Strict 1px borders between panels for separation.
- Dark, high-contrast palette for focus and clarity.
- Active workspace glow to show hotkey context.
- Floating action buttons for key actions (export, send to lab, add to scene).

## Onboarding Flow
- Draw first pin in Forge.
- Apply Pulse vibe in Lab.
- Drag to Stage from the tray.
- Add a second state to demonstrate interactivity.

## Build Command Center (Studio OS)
- Separate "mission control" app for tracking a 250-step build roadmap.
- Metadata config and phase constants drive progress dashboards.
- Operator manual and phase summaries guide execution.

## Landing Page Blueprint
- Hero showing the full pipeline (Forge -> Lab -> Stage).
- Four-pillar feature grid.
- Technical proof (60fps, JSON export, engine logos).

## Narrative Manifest
- Origin story page for Errl (creative context paired with technical output).
- Highlight character intent, material, and vibe stack.

## Glossary
- Atom: raw SVG/PNG asset.
- Molecule: asset + vibe settings.
- Organism: scene composed of assets and components.
- Forge: focus editor for single asset.
- Stage: scene layout canvas.
- Vibe Check: real-time effect tuning.
