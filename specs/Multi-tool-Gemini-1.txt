To help you build this in **Cursor**, I have organized the architecture into three distinct Markdown files. You can copy these into your project root as `.md` files.

### 1. `PRD_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`

This file explains the "What" and "Why" to Cursor, ensuring it understands the relationship between the Pin/SVG Creator and the Scene Maker.

### 2. `ARCH_DATA_SCHEMA.md`

This defines the JSON structure so Cursor can write the logic for saving/loading and passing data between the "Focus" and "Stage" windows.

### 3. `UI_LAYOUT_SPEC.md`

This describes the dual-viewport system and the contextual sidebars.

## File 1: PRD_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md

```markdown
# Project Overview: Integrated Component & Scene Creator

## Core Concept
A unified creative suite that handles the full pipeline of asset creation:
1. **Asset Creation (The Atom):** SVG/PNG Designer and "Pin" Creator.
2. **Logic & FX (The Molecule):** Component Maker / FX Lab / Vibe Check (adding behavior to assets).
3. **Layout (The Universe):** Scene Maker (a playground for layering props and components).

## Workflow Logic
- **Starting Point:** Users create or import an SVG/PNG.
- **The "Focus" Editor:** A dedicated window for surgical editing of a single asset (SVG Editor/Pin Designer).
- **The "Stage" Canvas:** A secondary window showing the full scene where multiple assets are layered.
- **Bi-directional Sync:** Changes in the Focus Editor must update all instances of that asset in the Scene Canvas in real-time.
- **Output:** Completed Scenes (Flash/Game ready) or standalone UI Components/Modules.

## Definitions
- **Prop:** A raw SVG or PNG asset.
- **Component:** A Prop plus "Vibe" data (FX, animations, or logic scripts).
- **Scene:** A JSON-based manifest of Props and Components positioned on a 2D stage.

## File 2: ARCH_DATA_SCHEMA.md

```markdown
# Data Architecture & JSON Schema

## State Management Strategy
The application uses a "Source of Truth" Library. The Scene Maker only stores **references** to IDs in the Library.

## The Unified Project Schema
```json
{
  "project": {
    "meta": { "name": "Untitled", "resolution": [1920, 1080] },
    "library": {
      "assets": [
        {
          "id": "uuid_01",
          "name": "Neon_Star",
          "type": "svg",
          "data": "<svg>...</svg>",
          "fx": { "glow": true, "pulse": 0.5 }
        }
      ],
      "components": [
        {
          "id": "comp_01",
          "name": "Health_UI",
          "base_asset": "uuid_01",
          "logic": "vibe_check_script_v1"
        }
      ]
    },
    "scene": {
      "layers": [
        {
          "id": "layer_1",
          "objects": [
            { "ref": "uuid_01", "x": 100, "y": 100, "z": 1, "scale": 1.0 }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Sync Engine:** When `library.assets[i].data` changes, re-render all objects in `scene.layers` referencing that ID.
2. **Export Modules:** - PNG/SVG Export for individual assets.
* JSON Manifest export for the full Scene.
* Script-bundled export for FX Lab components.



```

## File 3: UI_LAYOUT_SPEC.md
```markdown
# UI/UX Specification: Dual-Viewport Studio

## Screen Division
1. **Left Panel (The Modes):** Vertical icon bar (SVG Edit, FX Lab, Scene Maker, Export).
2. **Center-Left Window (Focus Workspace):** - High-detail zoom view of the active SVG/Pin.
   - Grid toggles and vector point manipulation.
3. **Center-Right Window (Scene Canvas):** - 16:9 aspect ratio "Stage."
   - Ability to drag, drop, and layer multiple assets.
4. **Right Panel (The Inspector):** - **Mode: SVG:** Show Stroke, Fill, Paths.
   - **Mode: FX/Vibe:** Show Animation Sliders, Pulse, Glow settings.
   - **Mode: Scene:** Show Layer Tree (Z-index management).
5. **Bottom Tray (The Asset Shelf):** - Visual thumbnails of all "Props" and "Components."

## Component Switching Logic
- Clicking an object in the **Scene Canvas** automatically loads it into the **Focus Workspace**.
- Switching "Modes" only changes the Tools (Sidebar) and the Inspector (Right Panel), not the Canvas positions.

## UI Styling (Vibe)
- Professional Dark Mode.
- Minimalist borders to maximize drawing space.
- Floating "Action" buttons for "Send to FX Lab" or "Add to Scene."

```

### How to use these in Cursor:

1. Create a folder called `.cursor-rules` (or just put them in your project root).
2. Start a chat in Cursor (**Cmd+L** or **Ctrl+L**).
3. Type: `@PRD_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md @ARCH_DATA_SCHEMA.md @UI_LAYOUT_SPEC.md Build the main layout shell using React/Tailwind (or your preferred stack) with a dual-viewport system.`

**Would you like me to generate a specific list of "Vibe Check" FX parameters for the FX Lab component?**
