# FX Lab: Interface & Parameter Controls

## The Vibe Check Panel
When in "FX Lab" mode, the right sidebar should display a "Vibe Stack."

1. **Active Vibe Selector:** A dropdown to add "Pulse," "Float," "Shake," or "Glow."
2. **Dynamic Sliders:** 
   - Each vibe has unique sliders (e.g., "Pulse" has `Scale Multiplier` and `Frequency`).
   - Use a "Live Preview" toggle to stop/start animations in the Focus Window.
3. **Vibe Presets:** Buttons for "Ghostly," "Aggressive," "Stable," and "Flicker." Clicking these should batch-update the sliders.

## Visual Feedback
- **Bounding Box:** In FX Lab mode, show a pulsing bounding box around the asset that reflects the "Vibe" in real-time.
- **On-Canvas Controls:** Allow users to drag a "Handle" in the Focus Window to set the `Amplitude` of a Float effect visually.
